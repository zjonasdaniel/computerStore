This project simulates a virtual store where you can buy computer products, its minimalist design seeks to highlight the features learned in the course.

## Tools used in development :
- This project was bootstrapped with **Create-React-App**
- The **JSX** javascript syntax was used to call functions and construct objects.
- The use of **Components** was used in order to avoid repeating code
- For navigation, **React-router-dom** is used
- The **Context** function of react was used, for the passage of variables and functions
- The information of each product was provided thanks to the implementation of **Firebase**
